# collage_event

This is a simple project I've made with html, css, javascript and jdbc.

# Aim:

A good Automating Student Performance Analysis system will automate user’s activities,
processes and practices, as well as increase their ability to handle a greater capacity of events.
 This is an efficient Automating Student Performance Analysis system software project that
serves the functionality of an event manager. The event manager is the person who plans and
executes the event, taking responsibility for the creative, technical and logistical elements.
This includes overall event design, C, Java and Extra Curricular Activities,. The system
allows only registered users to login and new users are allowed to register on the application.
 The project provides most of the basic functionality required for an event. It allows the user
to select from a list of event types. Once the user enters an event type the system then allows
the user to select the date and time of event.
